/**
 * Route-specific configuration. One subtype per route, each owning the wire
 * key names of its v2 route section. Never part of the shared document.
 *
 * Entries carry the wire's raw 64-bit bit-pattern: unsigned fields use their
 * exact bits, signed fields use two's complement. Typed fields are restored
 * with explicit bit casts and never clamped; out-of-range values are rejected
 * by the validation pass instead of being silently rewritten.
